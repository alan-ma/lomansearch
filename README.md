A project created for my English class as a representation of Death of A Salesman. It shows the journey of life and trying to achieve one's goals.<br>
Created using the canvas element with plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Yes, the code's really messy (all in one HTML file)!!!!<br>
Forgive the horrendous code structure because I made it in the span of <3 hours. It served its purpose as a school project, so I'm happy with it.<br>
